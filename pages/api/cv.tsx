ABOUT ME

Kia ora, I'm a software developer and designer based in Wellington, New Zealand. I'm interested in web design and development, video game development, UX, and technical leadership. I'm looking for a job that will push me to excel, teach me new things, and allow me to be creative.

I consider myself a technical generalist - I'm passionate, quick to pick up new skills, and have a wide range of knowledge from development to design and everything in between. In my spare time I enjoy trying out new web frameworks, having a go at 3D modelling, or trying to figure out how to build a home media server.

In a professional setting, I'm interested in stepping into more responsibility, improving my leadership skills, and understanding how to build better teams. I'm a lead working on a large programme of work that is pivotal to the way our organisation exists in the technical space. We're working with a technical stack that includes Next.js, Tailwind, Vercel, GitHub, AWS, Pulumi.
